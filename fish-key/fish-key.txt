Fish key

My friend <a href="http://aand.dkonto.pl/chmur/" title="Agata's website" target="_blank">Agata</a> had a good idea of creating a key for <a href="http://musicnotation.org/systems/group/whole-step-5-lines/" title="alternative 12-tone music notation" target="_blank">12-tone equal music notation</a>. It's called Fish key and it shows where F sharp (Fis in German naming) note is laying. Enjoy!
